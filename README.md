Replicate config from VSCode:
All you need to do is move the settings.json file and .vscode folder from one computer to another, and place them at the correct location. If you haven't specified a different path for those files, their locations for different operating systems can be found on this this page for settings.json and this page for .vscode/extensions.
settings.json:

.vscode:
